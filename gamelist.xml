The gates are magically locked by the temples of Stone, Paper and Scissors. You must break the seals using the proper medallion in each temple, which you have to find. The magic column is unlocked using a key in the keyhole located next to the column. Cheril can get three magic charges from the pedestals with two hearts engraved.

You can open the gates and the magic column in any order. You can also take a look at a map telling you where everything is located. You can only carry one object at a time. Controls:	D-pad: Movement; Select: Continue (title screen) / Map (ingame); Start: Starts the game from the beginning (title screen) / Pause; B: Interact / use / action, etc.; A: Jump; B + UP: Activate super powers.</desc>

Successfully leap over 100 of them, and you win the game! Use the Start button to begin the game, or reset the game during a game over. Use the A button to jump. Happy trails!</desc>

(If you are the only player, you will play against terrible bots) Different rounds will have different alternate objectives, such as the battle round, where you also get points for killing your enemies. Move your ship with the control pad.  Press A to shoot, although you can only shoot once every few seconds.  You can kill opponents by shooting them, or by colliding with them from above. The first player to 100 points wins the round. Win 3 rounds to win the game. From time to time, powerups will fly across the top of the screen. Shoot them to get that power for the rest of the round.</desc>

          <desc>A hippie guitarist who has visited your small town for years has gone rogue and launched ICBMs toward your town. Break out the fireworks that you had been saving for Independence Day, turn them into makeshift anti-ballistic missiles (ABMs), and shoot down the incoming missiles. Each of two silos starts with 15 ABMs. Place the aiming cursor in front of the incoming missile and fire an ABM to destroy it. Defend the town for seven nights (Sunday through Saturday) and you win! Screen shows cursor, missiles, balloon, MIRV, explosions, ammo, score, and time.Game play screen. Click to show or hide names of the game objects. You have to lead your shot a bit because it takes a split second for the ABM to arrive. But the explosion of an ABM is wide enough to destroy several missiles, so aim where the incoming missiles' paths are about to cross. Balloons and multiple independent reentry vehicle (MIRV) missiles will release a payload of multiple missiles if not shot down promptly. At the end of each round, the silos are refilled with ABMs: 15 each or 20 if only one silo remains. A destroyed silo will get rebuilt at the end of a night or once you've lasted one round with no destroyed houses. And if a house has been destroyed, one house will be rebuilt the next day. Later in the week, when more houses are gone, you need not worry about missiles aimed at wreckage. The game is over once both silos or all ten houses have been destroyed, or once you have survived all seven nights.</desc>
